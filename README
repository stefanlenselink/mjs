MP3 Jukebox System (mjs)

MJS is a console mp3-player with some special features not found in most
console based mp3-players. It features a search function, playlist saving
and loading and an easy to use interface.


Why
===

About oktober 2000, at my students'union you could only play tapes or compact
discs. The cds had often many scratches on them and listening to them had
become extermely hard. This is when I thought that maybe it was time to do
something about it.

I had this old pentium-60 lying somewhere and I had some experience with
diskless linux-clients. So I decided to give it a try. After equiping the
Pentium with a cheapo soundcard, nic and mda and setting up linux, I came to
the problem of choosing an mp3-player.

It had to be console based to keep it simple, but it being simple to use was a
must. After searching a couple of days on the internet I came up with mms
(Matt's MP3 Selector). This software fulfilled many of our wishes but missed
some. So I decided as it was GPL licensed to have a go at it.

At that time I didn't have any knowledge of C at all, so my efforts were done
by trial and error. After about half a year I had a C++ programming class at
the university and a few months later I had enough knowledge to begin seriously
hacking the old program into something better fulfilling our wishes.

I added a search function, that uses slocate databases, playlist loading /
saving, somewhat more studentproof interface, easier directory navigation,
more configuration options and so on.

Controlling it
==============

TAB cycles between active windows.
ARROW KEYS are for basic navigation. pgup/pgdn, home/end also work.

In ALL windows:
   * 'F1' exit the mp3-jukebox
   * 'F2' will clear the playlist after confirmation
   * 'F3' lets you search files
   * 'F4' shows your last search results
   * 'F5' will randomize the playlist
   * 'F6' will save your playlist (if enabled in .mjsrc)
   * 'F7' will stop the player
   * 'F8' will pause the player
   * 'F9' will go back one song
   * 'F10' will fast rewind
   * 'F11' will fast forward
   * 'F12' will advance one song

In the files window:
   * return adds files to the playlist and changes directory.
   * left-arrow goes back one directory
   * right-arrow enters directory
   * alt-enter inserts selected file into playlist
   * Pressing an letter will take you to the first directory starting with
     that letter   

In the playlist window is where the good stuff goes on:
   * with + and - you can move mp3's forward or backward in the playlist 
   * DEL will remove a song from the playlist (unless it is playing!)


HALLO! de Bolk!
